# DATA_SCIENCE_HELLO_WORLD_SALARY_PREDICTION_USING_LINEAR_REGRESSION

## Project Objective:
We have to predict the salary of an employee given how many years of experience they have.

### Dataset:
It has 2 columns — “Years of Experience” and “Salary” for 30 employees in a company. So in this example, we will train a Simple Linear Regression model to learn the correlation between the number of years of experience of each employee and their respective salary. Once the model is trained, we will be able to do some sample predictions.
